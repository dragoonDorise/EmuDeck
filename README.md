EmuDeck is a collection of scripts that allows you to autoconfigure your Steam Deck or any other Linux Distro, it creates your roms directory structure and downloads all of the needed Emulators for you along with the best configurations for each of them. EmuDeck works great with [Steam Rom Manager](https://github.com/SteamGridDB/steam-rom-manager) or with [EmulationStation DE](https://es-de.org)

# How to use EmuDeck?

# Developers, developers, developers.

If you wanna help us improve EmuDeck we are open to accept your PR! Just keep in mind this simple guide:

- Think that EmuDeck is for everybody, tech savvy and is specially directed to regular users that are new to Emulation, so everything has to be properly explained.
- Things using sudo are a big no no, there are exceptions but always try to find a way of prevent using sudo.
- Every Emulator needs to have a SRM profile and follow the AmberElec hotkey mapping.
- Always do your PR to the dev branch.
